# Bank-Churn-Prediction

This is a project of prediction analysis to build a predicition model of customer churn. It need several Python tools such as:
1. matplotlib
2. sklearn
3. seaborn
4. xgboost

To test the accuracy result, you can use different prediction model, this projects only use three algorithm; Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
